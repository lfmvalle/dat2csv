# File name restraints

The script is ready-to-go with the default file names generated by the **Properties** program. You can rename these files whatever you want, as long as you strictly follow these two rules:

- The file name **MUST** contain "*band*", "*doss*", "*cohp*", **OR** "*coop*" keywords (case insensitive);
- The file name **MUST** end with the "*.DAT*" file extension (also case insensitive).

If these requirements are not met, then the script will treat the file as invalid, automatically removing it from the file processing queue.

The script looks for keywords in the file name in alphabetical order: <br> *band* > *doss* > *cohp* > *coop* <br>
In the case of a file name containing two or more of the expected keywords, only the first keyword found is validated. This can potentially lead to unexpected errors.

> **Example:** <br> A DAT file named `some-coop-doss-cohp-band.dat`. <br> In this case, `band` is validated (the first match in alphabetical order), and the script will try to parse the file as it was a `BAND.DAT` file. If the file is not a proper Electronic Band Structure DAT, the script will crash with unexpected errors. In the worst case scenario, it may wrongly parse the file and produce completely arbitrary results.

I don't see why someone would name a file like this, but either way: **just don't!**
